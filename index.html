    <h2>Vulkan Renderer</h2>
    <p>This was submitted as the final deliverable for the Games Programming university course at DMU Leicester.
    It is a rendering application which utilises the Vulkan API to render a 3D scene with PBR lighting.
    <br>The entire project, including build files and dependencies, were made from scratch.<br>
    It is currently still in development as more features are being added, with plans to develop it into a game engine for learning purposes.</p>

  <h2>Asteroid Belt</h2>
  <p>This was the project we worked on during our "Performant Rendering" class.
    A working game was provided, using an existing game engine, and our goal was to use modern optimisation techniques to improve frame times and memory utilisation.
    <br>For this, I implemented:<br>
    <ul>
    <li>Entity Component System (ECS)</li>
    <li>Removed redundant GPU bindings</li>
    <li>Deferred rendering</li>
    <li>Level of Detail (LOD) using MeshOptimizer</li>
    <li>SIMD instructions</li>
    <li>Broadphase collision detection</li>
    <li>Instanced rendering</li>
    Throughout the project, I tracked and recorded performance differences using the Tracy profiler, assisted by RenderDoc and Nvidia Nsight usage.
  </ul>

    <h2>Witch Hunt</h2>
    <p>This is a prototype for an online multiplayer ARPG game.
      Developed using Unreal Engine, "Witch Hunt" was a group project. The purpose of 
      which was to learn how to utilise C++ efficiently within Unreal Engine,
      as well as implementing an online multiplayer aspect.
      <br>I was responsible for:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Player Movement</li>
        <li>Creating a modular spell system</li>
        <li>Implementing each team member's code within the project</li>
      </ul>

  <h2>Space Fighter</h2>
  <p>A very simple spaceship shooter game made for my JavaScript module during the second year of University.
    The goal was to demonstrate an understanding of the JavaScript language focusing on real time graphics.
    The inspiration for this project was a PlayStation2 game called "Psyvariar".
